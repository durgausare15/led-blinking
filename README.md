"Excited to share my latest project as an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student: 'Simulation on LED Blinking using Arduino.' 🛠️💡 For this task, I utilized an Arduino Uno, a yellow LED, and a 10k resistor. Great way to dive into the basics of microcontroller programming and electronics! #Arduino #LEDblinking #ElectronicsEngineering #TechProjects"
